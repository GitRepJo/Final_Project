# Final_Project
Unity3d scripts for simulation of an inland navigation small vessel and 
ROS2 packages for data processing.

The aim of this project is to develop a software architecture that allows for the                  
integration of virtual sensors in the navigation subsystem of a guidance, navigation         
and control system of a small vessel in the inland navigation sector. In addition       
to the integration of virtual sensors, the architecture should be easily extendable           
towards the utilization of real sensors.  

Due to copyright reasons, the virtual sensors itself are not published here.      
However a rosbag is supplied with data from the sensors as recorded in ROS2.
