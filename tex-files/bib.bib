   abstract = {Rigid-body rotations using rotation matricesIn Chapter 2 it was shown how to represent the position and orientation of one coordinate system relative to another. Further, it was shown how to transform the coordinates of a point from one coordinate system to another.The techniques introduced in Chapter 2 can also be used to define the rotation of a rigid body in space. Any rigid body can be thought of as a collection of points. Suppose that the coordinates of all the points of a body are known in terms of a coordinate system A. The body is then rotated γ degrees about a unit vector m that passes through the origin of the A coordinate system. The objective is to determine the coordinates of all the points in the rigid body after the rotation is accomplished (see Figure 12.1).This problem is equivalent to determining the coordinates of all the points in a rigid body in terms of a coordinate system B that is initially coincident with coordinate system A but is then rotated – γ about the m axis vector (see Figure 12.2). This problem was solved in Chapter 2 using rotation matrices.An alternate solution using quaternions will be introduced in this chapter. Quaternions in many instances may represent a more computationally efficient method of computing rotations of a rigid body compared to the rotation matrix approach. An increase in computational efficiency implies that fewer addition and multiplication operations are required.},

In this paper, a nonlinear robust adaptive control strategy is developed to force an underactuated surface ship to follow a predefined path at a desired speed, despite the presence of environmental disturbances induced by wave, wind and ocean-current. The proposed controller is scalable and is designed using Lyapunov's direct method and the popular backstepping and parameter projection techniques. Along the way of proving closed-loop stability, we obtain a new stability result for nonlinear cascade systems with non-vanishing uncertainties. Interestingly, it is shown in this paper that our developed control strategy is easily extendible to situations of practical importance such as parking and point-to-point navigation. Numerical simulations using the real data of a monohull ship are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for path following of underactuated ships.},

Since from an autonomy perspective, the automotive domain has started earlier and therefore has achieved a higher degree of technical progress, we will start with an overview of the developments in this domain. After that, the paper discusses the requirements on automation and assistance systems in the maritime domain and gives an overview of the developments into this direction within the maritime domain. This then allows us to compare developments in both domains and to derive recommendations for further developments in the maritime domain at the end of this paper.},

This method was executed in three steps, firstly to detect lane markings we employed the spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method. Secondly, in order to determine the surface course a distance clustering analysis was implemented and lastly, the road geometry design was estimated with preliminary results being gathered and tested on a group of consecutive frames to prove its effectiveness.},

Unlike commonly used simulation systems in robotic research?e.g., USARSim, Gazebo, etc.?in this work our development is based on a robot operation system (ROS) and with a different game engine, Unity3D. Compared with Unreal Engine, which is used in USARSim, Unity3D is much easier for entry level developers and has more users in the industry. On the other hand, as we know, ROS can provide a clear software structure and simultaneous operation between hardware devices for actual UAVs. By developing a data transmitting interface, a communication module and detailed environment and sensor modeling techniques, we have successfully glued ROS and Unity3D together for real-time UAV simulations. Another key point of our work is that we propose an efficient multi-UAV simulation structure and successfully simulate multiple UAVs, which is a challenging task, running 40Hz LIDAR (Light detection and ranging) sensing and communications in complex environments. The simulator structure is almost the same as real flight tests. Hence, by using the developed simulation system, we can easily verify develop flight control and navigation algorithms and save substantial effort in flight tests.},

However, in recent years much progress has been made in these areas. In this review we discuss ideas for the efficient implementation of the HT and present results on the analytic and empirical performance of various methods. We also report the relationship of Hough methods and other transforms and consider applications in which the HT has been used. It seems likely that the HT will be an increasingly used technique and we hope that this survey will provide a useful guide to quickly acquaint researchers with the main literature in this research area.},

Autoware is a popular open-source software project that provides a complete set of self-driving modules, including localization, detection, prediction, planning, and control. We customize and extend the software stack of Autoware to accommodate embedded computing capabilities. In particular, we use DRIVE PX2 as a reference computing platform, which is manufactured by NVIDIA Corporation for development of autonomous vehicles, and evaluate the performance of Autoware on ARM-based embedded processing cores and Tegra-based embedded graphics processing units (GPUs). Given that low-power CPUs are often preferred over high-performance GPUs, from the functional safety point of view, this paper focuses on the application of Autoware on ARM cores rather than Tegra ones. However, some Autoware modules still need to be executed on the Tegra cores to achieve load balancing and real-time processing. The experimental results show that the execution latency imposed on the DRIVE PX2 platform is capped at about three times as much as that on a high-end laptop computer. We believe that this observed computing performance is even acceptable for real-world production of autonomous vehicles in certain scenarios.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a unique real-time obstacle avoidance approach for manipulators and mobile robots based on the artificial potential field concept. Collision avoidance, tradi tionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, al lowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. This method has been extended to moving obstacles by using a time-varying artificial patential field. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm mechanisms and have used a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator con trol problem as direct control of manipulator motion in oper ational space?the space in which the task is originally described?rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kine matic transformation. Outside the obstacles' regions of influ ence, we caused the end effector to move in a straight line with an upper speed limit. The artificial potential field ap proach has been extended to collision avoidance for all ma nipulator links. In addition, a joint space artificial potential field is used to satisfy the manipulator internal joint con straints. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed by using visual sensing.},

Its open source status, fine grained control, and high fidelity place Gazebo in a unique position to become more than just a stepping stone between the drawing board and real hardware: data visualization, simulation of remote environments, and even reverse engineering of blackbox systems are all possible applications. Gazebo is developed in cooperation with the Player and Stage projects (Gerkey, B. P., et al., July 2003), (Gerkey, B. P., et al., May 2001), (Vaughan, R. T., et al., Oct. 2003), and is available from http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/ gazebo.html.},

   abstract = {Simulation software is becoming an increasingly important tool for automation systems both in industry and research. Within the field of mobile robotics, it is used to evaluate the performance of robots regarding localization, motion planning and control. In order to evaluate the performance of a mobile robot based on a simulation, the simulation must be of sufficient precision and accuracy. A commonly used middleware in robotics with increasing usage and importance is ROS (Robot Operating System). The community and the amount of robots in industry and research that are using ROS is growing. In the ROS community, the built-in simulator Gazebo is most often used for simulating purposes. Apart from Gazebo, popular game engines, like Unity, shift more in the focus of researchers for simulating robots. Those engines provide high capabilities in customized visualisations of simulations, the user interface and for example additional plugins for machine learning. Simultaneously, the physics engines which calculate the physical behaviour of objects in regard to their environment in those game engines are improving their performance. The performance of Unity as a simulatorin the ROS environment should be tested in this thesis work. While testing the performance of the simulator, its ability to adapt to different scenarios and applications should be rated. For that purpose, benchmarks were created and the results were compared to reality and Gazebo. The simulations in Unity could depict the basic behaviour of mobile robots for varying circumstances. The simulation for the specific setup in Unity was more detailed and closer to reality than the simulation in Gazebo. A major influence for that result was a non-existing controller for the wheels in Gazebo. Quantitative benchmarks showed a similar behaviour to reality in the Unity simulations. The results were highly dependent on the friction values and other simulation parameters. With the chosen setup, Unity showed systematic and nonsystematic errors in the end-position of predefined paths. A SLAM case study presented the possibility to use Unity in combination with SLAM algorithms on ROS. It was possible to implement other algorithms and simulate required sensors for data acquisition in Unity. Overall, Unity was rated to be suitable for the simulation of mobile robots in robotics research if no accurate simulation of the robots' properties is needed. Of major importance when conducting simulations with mobile robots in Unity are the used robot model and the chosen parameters in the simulation. Only if the robot model is validated, the results can be judged accordingly. To reduce the effect of the parameter settings in Unity on the results, no setups to solely examine the robot's hardware should be chosen. Instead, the simulations can be used for testing, improving and evaluating control algorithms on the robot. A huge opportunity is seen in the usage of automatically and synthetically generated simulation data for teaching deep learning algorithms.},

   journal = {Ocean Engineering},
   volume = {201},
   abstract = {Although road-based freight transport has large external costs, it currently dominates the hinterland cargo transport sector in Europe. An increase of the automation levels of inland cargo vessels could advance their competitiveness, hence unlocking more sustainable inland cargo transport. Moreover, these improvements could pave the way for a potential future paradigm shift towards unmanned inland cargo vessels. Therefore, this study investigates the design of an experimental platform in order to study the feasibility and current or future limitations of unmanned inland cargo vessels. To explore this design, the following three questions were handled: (i) How to design an industrially relevant research vessel?, (ii) How can an unmanned inland cargo vessel interact with or perceive its environment?, and (iii) How to control an unmanned or autonomous inland cargo vessel? The answers to these design questions delivered the blueprint to construct a first prototype of an unmanned inland cargo vessel. This prototype performed a set of outdoor experiments to verify and validate the made design choices. The successful execution of these experiments demonstrates that this vessel can serve as an experimental platform for further technological research regarding more automated or unmanned inland cargo vessels and provide fruitful insights for other research domains.},

In this paper, we will introduce our newly developed Unity3D/Microsoft Visual Studio (VS) simulation platform for USV path planning. In Unity3D server, a virtual water surface environment is built for USV navigation. In VS client, A* path planning algorithm is implemented. Data transmission between Unity3D and VS is implemented through TCP/IP protocol. Besides, a 2d lidar sensor is modeled in Unity3D to detect local obstacles and used for static local obstacle avoidance. Finally, optimal and collision-free USV path planning can be realized in our simulation platform. The virtual water surface environment, lidar modeling and socket communication can make USV path planning simulations fit well with actual experiments.},
